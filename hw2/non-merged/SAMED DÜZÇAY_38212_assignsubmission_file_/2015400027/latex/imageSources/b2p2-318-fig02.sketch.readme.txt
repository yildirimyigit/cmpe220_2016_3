The figure is drawn using "Sketch". It is a digital design app for Mac.
You can find the detailed information about the app from its website: https://www.sketchapp.com/

Every part of the figure is drawn separately.
Therefore one can easily change anything, or construct any other shape using its parts.

Once you open the figure in Sketch, you will see a structure like this:
(Dashes represent a group of elements)
